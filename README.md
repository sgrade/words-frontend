# Getting started from a new dev workstation

## Prerequisites

[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

[Angular CLI](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)

[Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)

## Installation

Clone this repo

Change directory
```
cd words-frontend
```

Install dependencies (they are listed in package.json)
```
npm install
```

Login to Firebase
```
firebase login --no-localhost
```

Create firebase-config.ts in the root directory of the project.  

Login to Firebase -> Choose project -> Project overview -> Project settings -> General -> Web apps -> Firebase SDK snippet -> Config

Copy the Config, prepend it with "export", paste into firebase-config.ts. So it should look like:

```
export const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "xxxxx",
  authDomain: "xxxxx",
  databaseURL: "xxxxx",
  projectId: "xxxxx",
  storageBucket: "xxxxx",
  messagingSenderId: "xxxxx",
  appId: "xxxxx",
  measurementId: "xxxxx"
};

```


Deploy to Firebase hosting
```
ng deploy
```


# Configure Angular project for Firebase hosting

Note: this is already done for this project, there is no need to do it again
```
ng add @angular/fire
```
As a result, the following files are changed:

angular.json, firebase.json, .firebaserc
